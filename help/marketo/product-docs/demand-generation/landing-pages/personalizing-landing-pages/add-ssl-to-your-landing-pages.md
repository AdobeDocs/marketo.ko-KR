# 랜딩 페이지에 SSL 추가 {#add-ssl-to-your-landing-pages}

SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption lets you make all of your landing pages for a Marketo instance secure.

When you fill out a web form or visit a landing page that&#39;s hosted by Marketo, by default the information is sent over non-secure protocol (HTTP). Per your company’s policy, you may want to secure the information submitted to Marketo over (HTTPS). 예를 들어, `http://info.mydomain.com/` 이제 `https://info.mydomain.com/`.

Marketo은 비보안 HTTP 프로토콜을 통해 기본적으로 &quot;방문한 웹 페이지&quot; 및 &quot;웹 페이지에서 링크 클릭&quot;을 추적합니다. If you want to have your tracking links secured with their own certificate, you need to have Marketo build a separate non-shared server to enable it. To secure all aspects of a contact&#39;s interaction with you typically means securing both landing pages and tracking links.

랜딩 페이지에 SSL 추가에 대한 FAQ는 다음을 참조하십시오 [이 문서](https://nation.marketo.com/t5/Knowledgebase/Overview-amp-FAQ-Secured-Domains/ta-p/300900).

If you would like SSL for your Marketo landing pages, please contact your Marketo sales rep.
